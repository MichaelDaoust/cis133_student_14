    <h3 id="furtherImprovements">How else would I improve site?</h3>
        <p>The reality is I believe this is a really <strong>great</strong> website. It is rather simple, but that is my preference. I enjoy the color scheme and photos; I am a beach and nature guy. I also love the colors <font color="blue"> blue</font> and <font style="background-color:blue;color: white;"> white</font>  together. </p>
